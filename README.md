# PowerShell

In This repository I have placed different powershell scripts which can be used for different scenarios

1. Using 7Zip4PowerShell module in the command to compress a folder with random password generated each time
2. Extracting specific values from JSON files
3. Invoking URL's using Invoke-WebRequest method
